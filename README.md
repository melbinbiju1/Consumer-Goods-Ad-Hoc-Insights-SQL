# 🚀 Finance-and-Top-N-Insights-Advanced-SQL

Welcome to my SQL project built for the fictional consumer electronics brand **AtliQ**. This project replicates a real-world business scenario in finance and product analytics — demonstrating my ability to build automated, scalable, and business-driven solutions using pure SQL.

---

## 🧩 Real-World Problem, Data-Driven Solution

As part of AtliQ’s analytics team, I took ownership of multiple business reporting needs across the **finance** and **product domains**, delivering a suite of SQL-based insights and tools to:

- 📊 Track product-level and market-level sales performance
- 💡 Empower product owners and finance teams with real-time reports
- ⚙️ Automate analytics using stored procedures and reusable logic
- 🌎 Uncover top markets, customers, and regions by net sales

---

## 📌 Project Highlights

### 🔹 1. Monthly Product Sales Report
Track sales trends at the **product + variant** level, aggregated monthly.
> Output: Month | Product Name | Variant | Sold Quantity | Gross Price per Item | Gross Price Total

---

### 🔹 2. Gross Sales Reporting
- Monthly and Yearly gross sales to **Croma India**
- Built reusable **Stored Procedures** for ease of reporting
- Parameterized for **multi-customer** support

---

### 🔹 3. Market Badge Classification (Gold / Silver)
> Business Rule:  
If `total_sold_qty > 5,000,000` → **Gold**  
Else → **Silver**

- Packaged as a **stored procedure**
- Input: Market & Fiscal Year
- Output: Market Badge

---

### 🔹 4. Top-N Reports
- **Top Markets**, **Top Products**, **Top Customers**
- Ranked using `RANK()` and `DENSE_RANK()`
- Available for any fiscal year with simple procedure call

---

### 🔹 5. Regional Analysis Reports
- Net Sales % Share by Region (APAC, EU, LATAM, NA)
- Top 2 Markets per Region using **Window Functions**
- Built to support visual dashboards in Power BI / Tableau

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools Used

| Skill/Tool             | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| **SQL (MySQL)**        | Joins, CTEs, Subqueries, Window Functions |

## 🔥 Why This Project Stands Out

✅ Built for **real stakeholders** (product owners, finance teams)  
✅ Focused on **business impact** — not just code  
✅ Demonstrates **data storytelling** + **technical skills**  
✅ Designed for **automation**, not one-time reporting  
✅ Built with **scalability and reuse** in mind (stored procs, param inputs)
